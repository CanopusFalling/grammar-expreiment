# Grammar Experiment

This is a quick project I made in a few minutes to find all the possible strings within a grammar, up to a set depth, for fun. You can read more about grammars [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar).

To input your grammar use the following format for a rule `A -> 0 | 1 | 0A | 1A` and place all rules as strings within the array `grammar_string` on line 177. Then set the depth using the function on line 179.

I might come back and clean this up into something much more useful though this is more of a quick toy than a formal product of any use.
